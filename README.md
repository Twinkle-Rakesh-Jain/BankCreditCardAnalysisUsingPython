# Bank Credit Card Analysis UsingPython

## Project Description
This project leverages two interrelated datasets—Customer Details and Credit Card Details—to analyze bank credit card usage patterns and derive insights into customer behavior, financial performance, and the influence of specific factors on key metrics. Visualizations created using Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, reveal trends in card usage, spending patterns, and revenue generation, offering actionable insights into customer segmentation and engagement strategies.

## Project Execution
### 1. Data Import and Exploration
a. Imported and explored two datasets—cust (Customer Details) and cc (Credit Card Details)—to understand the features available for analysis.

b. Conducted initial inspections using head(), info(), and describe() to evaluate column characteristics and identify any missing values.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
a. Assessed and addressed missing values where necessary.

b. Created derived columns such as Age_Group and Income_Group to segment customers by demographic profiles.

c. Added a Total_Revenue column in the credit card dataset by calculating the sum of Annual Fees, Interest Earned, and Total Transaction Amount.

### 3.Visual Analysis of Key Metrics
a. Customer Segmentation: Visualized customer distribution by Card_Category, Income_Group, and Age_Group to understand demographics.

b. Usage Patterns: Analyzed credit limit distribution, revolving balance, transaction amounts, and utilization ratios across different card categories.

c. Revenue Analysis: Studied revenue trends quarterly and across card categories to identify high-revenue segments.

d. Chip Usage: Explored chip usage by category and gender to assess technology adoption.

e. Expenditure Type: Visualized spending categories to reveal popular expenditure types and their distribution.

f. Correlation Matrix: Created a heatmap to examine correlations between numeric features and identify key drivers of revenue and balance.

### 4.Visualization Summary
A total of 14 key visualizations were created to explore and present insights on customer demographics, transaction trends, revenue distribution, and credit utilization.

## Project Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of bank credit card customers and their financial behaviors through various Python-based visualizations. Key insights include:

### 1. Customer Segmentation: 
Identifying high-revenue customer groups by analyzing card category distribution, age groups, and income levels.
### 2. Usage and Revenue Trends: 
Insights into transaction volumes, credit limit usage, and revenue patterns to refine customer engagement and marketing strategies.
### 3. Risk and Financial Performance: 
By understanding the correlation between revolving balance and interest earned, the bank can optimize credit offerings and manage risk.


The findings provide a valuable foundation for enhancing customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and strategic decision-making in credit management.
